TODO
----

- Show style and ext style flags. Do not sync with boolean properties with same meaning. Show
  numeric edit field that allows entering the numeric value for all. Sync flags and numeric
  field.
- Remove dlg_ and cred_ prefixed from files.
? Remove entries from propertyLabel enum that are only used in one ctrl type.
  They can just be strings in the spec. Check: Only if they are used in one place (spec).
? Remove label param from functions to add/set a property for dialogs/controls b/can
  the label can be read from the given property object.
- Remove addLabeledProperty, addPositionalProperty, and addSerializedProperty from Control
  and Dialog classes. Instead init the classes with all properties from the spec and used
  builder classes in the parser to collect the parsed properties and then apply them to
  the control/dialog.
